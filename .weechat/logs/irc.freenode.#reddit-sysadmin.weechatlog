2020-02-06 17:33:45	dsockwell	i never used it
2020-02-06 17:33:48	+A-KO	seriously. Like compared to the amount of shit that's out there. Redhat's market is *small* for RHEL, or rather; smaller than what's deployed and almost non-existent in comparison.
2020-02-06 17:33:52	Kb03	But, yeah. I did that, fuck, when I was 13 I think
2020-02-06 17:34:03	+A-KO	You've got like government using RHEL, maybe some big orgs that want the support.
2020-02-06 17:34:05	int0x1C8	so I wanted to know "under what conditions or whatever does it send a new position update? if there are none how can we assure the location is at least from the same day"

2020-02-06 17:36:05	+A-KO	StrongBad: Because nothing else matters in the industry? Like, chances are you're using MDM so people can access things like e-mail, documents, etc. So you've got an O365 deployment likely. And at that point Intune is *fucking free* so why bother with anything else?
2020-02-06 17:36:39	Kb03	Ha! my school doesn't use MDM
2020-02-06 17:36:39	+A-KO	JAMF is a strong contendor for anything Apple-related, but only marginally because JAMF stays close to the mac ecosystem and a lot of mac folks know how to use it.

2020-02-06 17:37:47	+A-KO	it's not a matter of fanboyism, it's a matter of just pure cost.

2020-02-06 17:38:03	@Code_Man65	StrongBad:  IBM products are pretty much universally over-complicated with shit support
2020-02-06 17:38:03	StrongBad	why rant about why IBM MDM sucks when you don't even know about it though
2020-02-06 17:38:05	int0x1C8	we don't get it for free

2020-02-06 19:08:59	mrbell1984	alazare619 you would think /sync would mean sync and /force would be force
2020-02-06 19:09:15	Sousapro	sometimes you just really need a reboot
2020-02-06 19:09:33	Sousapro	it makes sense
2020-02-06 19:09:37	alazare619	certain policies cant apply during normal operation
2020-02-06 19:09:45	alazare619	some can only apply prior to network initilization

2020-02-06 19:11:24	alazare619	different
2020-02-06 19:11:30	Sousapro	except reapplying preferences that shouldn't be reapplied

2020-02-06 19:12:03	alazare619	Sousapro it only re-applies whats changed
2020-02-06 19:12:10	alazare619	so if the preference never changed it wont re-apply
2020-02-06 19:12:29	alazare619	unless they are using replace...in which case then it will blink i think
2020-02-06 19:12:50	Sousapro	I always thought it would reapply all gpos

2020-02-06 19:13:55	alazare619	what it basically does is heres the gpo's you should have here try to re-apply

2020-02-06 19:20:49	alazare619	I always keep 1 physical rodc

2020-02-06 19:20:52	alazare619	Exactly
2020-02-06 19:20:56	Alternity	if anyone is still scared of virtualized DC's in 2020

2020-02-06 19:22:54	Sousapro	why not just use radius auth for DHCP?
2020-02-06 19:22:59	Sousapro	or port whitelisting?
2020-02-06 19:23:02	Sousapro	or both
2020-02-06 19:23:04	Sousapro	try both
2020-02-06 19:23:13	khelpw	Recently got them changed over from using windows server backup   going to tape drives over to a datto
2020-02-06 19:23:22	khelpw	because none of that is even necessary - they have a flat network with only 1 location.
2020-02-06 19:23:37	Sousapro	what about offline archives?
2020-02-06 19:23:47	Sousapro	or does literally no one care about that anymore?

2020-02-06 19:24:49	Sousapro	I just would like the offline revenge proof backups for a business
2020-02-06 19:24:57	khelpw	In this case though, we've got short term local, 1 year off-site via datto.
2020-02-06 19:25:02	Sousapro	it would take me like five minutes to end all backups here
2020-02-06 19:25:18	Sousapro	I would never do it
2020-02-06 19:25:21	khelpw	all encrypted everywhere etc. Good stuff.

2020-02-06 19:39:56	Jangles	Issue seems to be that you need to specify by IP address, and YouTube has thousands, so then my thought was to have a GPO "lock" YouTube down to a single IP, then throttle bandwidth for that one IP, though I don't know how YouTube's content delivery network functions.
